FolderLock is a free, browser-based file encryption web app that lets anyone password-protect their files without installing any software or creating an account. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs 100% in the browser — meaning your files never leave your device or get uploaded to any server.
How it works is simple: you drop your files in, set a password, and the tool compresses and encrypts them into a single .locked file you can download and store anywhere — a USB drive, cloud storage, or email. To get your files back, you upload the .locked file, enter the password, and all your original files are instantly restored.
Under the hood it uses AES-256-GCM encryption, the same standard used by banks and governments, combined with PBKDF2 key derivation at 200,000 rounds which makes brute-force attacks extremely slow. Every encryption uses a random salt and IV, so even the same password produces a different output each time.
Key features include drag-and-drop file selection with file type icons, built-in compression that can shrink files by up to 80%, a password strength meter, show/hide password toggle, custom naming for the locked file, a full reset button, and support for encrypting multiple files at once into one vault.
The website itself is fully responsive and works on any device — desktop, tablet, or phone — across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge with no installation needed.
Built by Vivek Kumar, a Class 11 student and hobbyist coder, FolderLock was created to solve a real problem: giving everyday people a simple, trustworthy way to protect their private files without needing technical knowledge or expensive software.
