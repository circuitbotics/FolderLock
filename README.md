# FolderLock
FolderLock is a free, browser-based file encryption web app that lets anyone password-protect their files without installing any software or creating an account. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs 100% in the browser — meaning your files never leave your device or get uploaded to any server.
